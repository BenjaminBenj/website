1 About theCrag - 9 Acceptable behaviour

<div class="coltext">

<h2>Acceptable site behaviour</h2>

<p>This document has been written to communicate our expectation of acceptable member behavior on the site. It does not extend to behavior at the crag, or general climbing ethics.</p>

<p>This is important for you, as an individual in the community, to understand because at times we might have to intervene with management decisions that may result in posts being removed, warning messages being sent, permissions being reduced or members being banned. Of course we hope none of this ever happens, but this is our role as a community moderator.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this document will not and cannot be comprehensive, as every incident has it’s own unique characteristics. However, we will add to this document as we learn more about moderating in a community and managing an information resource.</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>Members of the thecrag community should feel comfortable to actively participate in the community using their own name.</p>

<p>We wish to foster free flowing discussions and development of content and ideas for the benefit of the climbing community.</p>

<p>Where these aims conflict we will have to make a decision.</p>

<p>We wish to be able to distribute content across mobile platforms using a reasonable content rating. In particular this will affect content with swearing.</p>

<p>Being derogatory against individuals or minority groups is not acceptable (see our <a href="/processmap/offensivecontentpolicy">Offensive Content Policy</a>).</p>

<h3>Resolving disputes</h3>

<p>If you have any problems then please get in contact with us privately (support@thecrag.com).</p>

<p>Public notification of behaviour issues is not helpful and may make resolution more difficult and we may not even respond because it may continue to inflame the issue.</p>

<p>It is much better if the aggrieved person contacts us, than an observer.</p>

<p>Our normal escalation process will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Courtesy message asking a member to resolve the situation themselves.</p></li>
  <li><p>Administrative removal of post, image or description.</p></li>
  <li><p>Official warning.</p></li>
  <li><p>Permissions reduced.</p></li>
  <li><p>Account disabled.</p></li>
</ul>

&nbsp;</br>

<p>Depending on the situation we may skip some of these steps.</p>

<p>Just so you know we don’t believe in a name and shame system, so we will not be doing that.</p>

<h3>Forums</h3>

<p>We are an information site and our forums are largely based around discussion of that information. Because of this we feel that moderation of discussions is important. There are plenty of more permissive forum sites out there if you want a more 'anything goes' environment.</p>

<p>If you have assumed you are having a private conversation when in actual fact it is a public area discussion or public ascent discussion and you have said something unedifying in the discussion then:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>You can ask us to unlink the discussion from the area or</p></li>
  <li><p>You can remove your ascent and relog it.</p></li>
</ul>

&nbsp;</br>


<p>Harassing somebody by continuing to post derogatory comments on somebodies ascents is not acceptable. People have the right to post ascents in any style they want without being harassed.</p>

<p>Please keep content discussions civil (for example route names and grades). If the focus changes from being constructive to being personally derogatory then we may remove the post.</p>

<p>Unapproved commercial posts may be removed. We accept that some commercial posts may have community value, if in doubt please ask us. We are much more likely to allow commercial posts if you have told us about what you are doing.</p>

<h3>Ascent comments</h3>

<p>While ascent comments are your own personal business, if you have a public account then these comments are publically viewable in search, and feeds. In which case please treat your comments the same way as you would an area discussion post.</p>

<p>If there is inappropriate content in a public ascent comment then we may have to remove the ascent.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Copyright is largely covered in our copyright statement and terms and conditions of system use. However there are some additional things worth mentioning here.</p>

<p>If you feel as though your copyright has been infringed then please contact us via our support email support@thecrag.com so we can investigate.</p>

<p>Please do not copy descriptions from websites or guidebooks- it is not good form and may be infringing copyright. However feel free to ask the website owner or publisher if they want to participate in our content system, as we are finding many publishers are finding thecrag to be something they want to use to help manage and develop their content.</p>

<p>As a user please do not scan topos from guidebooks. In some instances this has been done with permission from the publisher, but we would appreciate you tell us that you have had permission.</p>

<h3>Route names</h3>

<p>While it might be your right to name a route anything you want, this does not extend to registering that name on thecrag public network. In particular route names that include selected swearing terms or phrases that are derogatory to individuals or minority groups may be edited.</p>

<p>It is unacceptable to change route and area names to slander somebody else.</p></p>

<p>If there is conflict over a route/area name then please involve us to make a ruling rather than changing names to and fro. Please be aware that the ‘alternate name’ facility should virtually remove any arguments in this regards.</p>

<p>We may actually end up referring to a person’s admin status or total Karma points to help us make a final decision. For example if we have appointed a coordinator for a crag then we would probably err on their side for naming decisions. Similarily somebody who has taken the time to make lots of contributions to thecrag may also be preferenced.</p>

<h3>Locally sensitive crags</h3>

<p>There are some crags around the world that have particular local sensitivities. On the whole we will err toward being accommodating of these sensitivities.</p>

<p>Sometimes crags under development need to be a little bit hidden so that the developer can just get on with development without worrying about hordes of people pushing their way up half completed routes. Depending on how sensitive this is you may consider keeping the crag name something generic, no approach descriptions and no geolocation. You may also want to register it in a test network first and move it across later. You should document what you are doing in the main description so that others know not to overwrite your decisions.</p>

<p>We are not a fan of the ‘locals only’ argument when a local climber asks us not to put a reference to their crag on the site. However in some cases there may be particular access issues which, if not adhered to, may jeopardize the crag remaining open (eg private land with path maintenance issues). In such cases we may keep the climb names, comment on the access issues, update the crag name with some indicator of the situation and remove the geolocation and approach descriptions.</p>

<p>Buying the local guidebook argument is something we have sympathy for, especially if the guidebook is tied to the ongoing funding for the local area. The local publisher would need to contact us and have a genuine discussion with us before we remove content. We actually support third party publishers so we would try and convince them to publish through us.</p>

<p>If we have made a management decision to remove content for reasons of local sensitivities we ask that you do not keep putting it back in because you disagree with us. It is much better to continue to work with the locals so that we can find a long term acceptable solution.</p>
