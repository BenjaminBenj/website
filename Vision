thecrag.com Vision


<h2>Sharing climbing information</h2>

<p>thecrag.com will become a hub for sharing and distributing climbing information, where climbers and publishers can share climbing information and distribute it through multiple channels, including thecrag.com's website, third party websites, rss feeds, Facebook, pdf publications, iphone, ipad and others.</p>

<p>Climbers will be able to access quality climbing information on the web for free, either directly through thecrag.com's website or through other third party portals. This will be supported by sponsorship and advertising.</p>

<p>Publishers will be able to use thecrag.com's system to control and distribute their information through non-web channels. They may also choose to supply this information for free on the web. This will be supported by revenue sharing.</p>

<p>thecrag.com will improve guidebook data with community ratings such as community stars, and ascent comments.</p>


<h2>Public verses private content</h2>

<p>Both public and private data will be supported by thecrag.com.</p>

<p>Content contributed directly by climbers will be publically available. </p>

<p>Content contributed by third pary publishers will be owned by the publisher under their copyright with thecrag.com as data custodian according to publisher agreements.</p>


<h2>Community edited guidbooks</h2>

<p>Rather than one person providing all the information for a guidebook, guidebooks can be built on the fly using incremental updates from climbers across the whole climbing community. An area champion(s) will be able to ensure data quality for a particular area.</p>

<p>Even just adding an an ascent improves the quality of the information in the guidebook by feeding back route popularity scores and climber quality ratings.</p>



<h2>Protect information</h2>

<p>By distributing the content to other websites and database, climbing information becomes better protected from issues around technology failures, organisation closures and dependance on individuals.</p>



<h2>Financially viablility</h2>

<p>We would like thecrag.com to become financially viable, or at a minimum, be able to pay it's own hosting and infrastructure costs. We plan to do this through advertising and sponsorship on thecrag.com's website. We will explore revenue sharing opportunities for developing new publisher channels. We will also explore other revenue opportunities when they come up.</p>


<h2>Initiatives under development</h2>


<h3>API</h3>

<p>We are developing an API, which will allow third party applications to interface to the thecrag.com's database. This should be ready about March 2011.</p>


<h3>Photo topos</h3>

<p>Climbers can upload a photo, and create a topo by drawing lines on the photo using only the browser. This is ready now</p>


<h3>Mapping tools</h3>

<p>Mapping tools to locate crags and climbs. This will be released imminantly.</p>


<h3>RSS feed</h3>

<p>Keep up-to-date with latest updates to an area, or the latest ascents from your friends. This is planned for release late 2010.</p>


<h3>Crag Guide</h3>

<p>A whole area guide, based on the latest information topos and maps. An intial version is being trialed now. You will be able to customise and personalise Crag Guide in future releases (eg Bouldering in Arapiles). A PDF version of Crag Guide is planned for some time in 2011.</p>

<p>Publishers will also be able to produce a Crag Guide with their content only.</p>


<h3>Publisher Content</h3>

<p>We are in discussion with several publishers, to allow them to use thecrag.com's infrastructure for their content. There are lot's of things to nut out here, but we should have content starting to trickle in late 2010.</p>


<h3>iPhone App</h3>

<p>An iphone app is planned to be released sometime after the API is complete.</p>
