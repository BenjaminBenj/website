Area Types

<p>There are a number of area types used in thecrag.com. By default an area node will have the generic 'Area' type assigned to it.</p>

<p>The area type of a node will determine enhanced features for system interfaces and web displays. This includes the available description fields and how description fields are inherited from the parent nodes.</p>

        <td>Area</td>
        <td>The generic area type for a new area.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Region</td>
        <td>This covers all areas from the world node down to the top level crag. This includes country pages. All areas below the top level crag should not be assigned as a region. Generally these pages are controlled by site management with very restrictive user permissions. If in doubt you should not assign an area as a region.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Crag</td>
        <td>A Crag area may be a major crag or minor crags. A crag can have crags as sub areas. The major crag could be a whole mountain range. Typically major crags feature in guidebook titles, and minor crags in guidebook chapter headings. A crag area type has additional description fields available. Assign Crag area types for all areas from a region down to a cliff.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cliff</td>
        <td>A Cliff area type should either have climbs or sector areas as children. Some description fields are inherited from the Crag level descriptions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sector</td>
        <td>Sector areas are sub areas under the cliff level. A sector should not have any sub areas just climbs.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Boulder</td>
        <td>A boulder area type is used to specify bouldering routes around a boulder.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Feature</td>
        <td>A feature can be a feature of a cliff or boulder. Generally it is used as a sub-type for bouldering purposes.</td>
