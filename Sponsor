<p>... but we do need to make some money to fund the ongoing maintenance and development of the site.</p>

<p>That's where sponsorship packages and classified listings come in.</p>

<p>The table below outlines our sponsorship and classifieds options. In return for supporting this site, these enable you to support and communicate with a targeted group of climbers via a range of channels including our website, PDF guidebooks and (in the future) mobile applications, and other channels.</p>


<p>Anonymous and individual donations are also welcome.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or you want to <strong>become a sponsor</strong> then please <a href="/article/contactus">contact us</a>.</p>


<p><strong>10% of all sponsorship</strong> revenue will be donated to third party, not for profit climbing causes and organisations (eg access organisations, bolting funds, etc). To start with, in 2012 our donor organisation will be CliffCare Victoria, and we’ll rotate it to new donors regularly.</p>

<p>* If there are two sponsors paying $10 a month to sponsor the same crag, they will receive an equal share of banners. If one sponsor is paying $20 a month and the other is paying $10, the first will receive ⅔ of the banners and the other will receive ⅓.</p>

<p>If you are sponsoring at a Region/Country level then your payment is divided amongst the crags based on Crag Kudos (a measure of the value of the crag to the climbing community).<p>

<p>Anyone can register a business for a basic listing, but the listing will not be activated until site management have verified the details with the business itself.</p>

<p>Once verified by site management, free business directory listings are valid for one year. After that we will contact you to confirm that it is still up to date and that you want to keep it for another year. This will help us ensure that the businesses listed in the business directory are current.</p>

<p>Basic listings are only available below the country level.</p>

<p>You apply for a basic listing by navigating to the crag, clicking on the 'Directory' tab then clicking on the 'Add a business listing' button.</p>
