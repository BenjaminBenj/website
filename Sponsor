<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 185%;margin: 30px;">Our users love climbing and love our site.</p>

<p>We are trying to <strong>keep the site free</strong> for our users, but we do need to make some money to fund the ongoing maintenance and development of the site.</p>

<p>That’s where sponsors come in.</p>

<p>The table below outlines our sponsorship packages. In return for supporting this site, these packages enable you to support and communicate with a targeted group of climbers via a range of channels including our website, PDF guidebooks and (in the future) mobile applications.</p>

<p>Anonymous and individual sponsorship/donations are also welcome.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or you want to <strong>become a sponsor</strong> then please <a href="/article/contactus">contact us</a>.</p>
