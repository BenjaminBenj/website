<p>... but we do need to make some money to fund the ongoing maintenance and development of the site.</p>

<p>That's where sponsorship packages and personal supporter packages come in.</p>

<p>The table below outlines our sponsorship options. In return for supporting this site, these enable you to support and communicate with a targeted group of climbers via a range of channels including our website, PDF guidebooks and (in the future) mobile applications, and other channels.</p>


<p>Anonymous and individual donations are also welcome.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or you want to <strong>become a sponsor</strong> then please <a href="/article/contactus">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>* If there are two sponsors paying $10 a month to sponsor the same crag, they will receive an equal share of banners. If one sponsor is paying $20 a month and the other is paying $10, the first will receive ⅔ of the banners and the other will receive ⅓.</p>

<p>If you are sponsoring at a Region/Country level then your payment is divided amongst the crags based on Crag Kudos (a measure of the value of the crag to the climbing community).<p>
