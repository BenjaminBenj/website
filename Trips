3 Create an account - 6 Climbing Trips

<p>We have introduced the concept of climbing trips, where you can share information between trip participants.</p>

<p>To use trips on the system the trip founder creates a new trip, then adds trip members.</p>

<p>Each trip member has access to the trip portal from their main account page.</p>

<p>Trip members may also upload photos and log ascents into the trip.</p>

<p>We plan to implement some additional trip features in the near future.</p>
