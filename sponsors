1 About theCrag - 8 Sponsorship

<p>We need sponsorship in order for us to improve the site infrastructure and site performance. We are really after longer term sponsorship relationships rather than one offs so we can provide ongoing improvements.</p>

<p>We are currently paying about 80 USD per month for site hosting on a virtual machine. While we are able to pay this for now, it does not give us the server grunt we would like. For $160 USD a month we can upgrade to the next level, which will almost double the number of people that can use the site simultaneously. For the same amount again we could split the system across two servers providing further increase in site performance.</p>

<p>Of course we would eventually like to get a dedicated server (or servers) in a high availability data center. This will cost significantly more money.</p>
