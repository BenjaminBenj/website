<p>The more quality content the site collects the better the service.</p>

<p>If you have done a climb and the route description or any of the other data is missing then please consider adding it.
 Likewise if you see that a new route has not been entered yet, please help s fill in the gaps.
 We are especially interested in helping the dedicated climbers who put up new routes share the word.
</p>

<p>We are also after some climbers who are willing to put a bit more into particular areas by becoming area champions. Area champions will be granted more permissions to maintain quality content for a particular area.</p>

<p>Finally if you want a more serious content role in the site then you can volunteer to become a country co-ordinator.</p>
