<h2>Introducing Crag Karma</h2>


<p>Crag Karma is a way of thecrag recognising user contributions to the index.
</p>
<p>Every time you contribute to the index, you are helping to build and improve this free online guide for the benefit of the whole climbing community.
</p>
<p>Karma points are added up across the index to give you a score for each area, up to the World level at the top of the index.
</p>
<p>Each contribution will add to your Karma points. You currently get points for the following: *

<h2>A few details</h2>
<p>
For a particular contribution type you will only get the points once for each node in the index. For example, if you upload more than one photo for a particular route you will get <% $ARGS{uploadPhoto} %> points in total for all uploaded photos for that route.
</p>
<p>
More than one person can get points for contributions to a particular node in the index.
</p>

<p>
* These may change from time to time.
</p>

<!--

<hr>

<p>The maximum points you can get for contributions to a particular route is <% $ARGS{maxRoute} %> points (for uploading a photo, making a topo, updating topo points, adding a route grade and route description).</p>

<p>The maximum un-rolled up points you can get for contributions to a particular area is <% $ARGS{maxArea} %> points (for uploading a photo, making a topo, updating topo points, adding an area description).</p>

<p>More than one climber can get points for contributions. For example if more than one climber contributes to a climb description then each climber will get <% $ARGS{routeDescription} %> points for their discription contribution.</p>

<p>In order to encourage quality contributions we record the account which made the contribution.</p>
