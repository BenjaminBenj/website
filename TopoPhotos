<p class="lead">
High quality photo-topos are the difference between boring pages of text and climbing porn that makes your fingers sweating to go climbing.
</p>

<p>This is our list of tips for making great topos that we've often learnt the hard way.




<h2>Tip 1: Good topos are NOT good climbing photos</h2>

<div class="bore"><div class="alert alert-info"><b>Remember: the whole point of any topo is to identify the key rock features and orient youself to the rock</b></div></div>
<p>This is why many well intentioned topos aren't helpful. A closeup oversaturated photo of your mate Jim screaming on the crux hold is great for a mag, or on your wall or posted to facebook.
 But it is the worst kind of topo photo. First the climber generally hides the route, secondly you are only likely to recognise the route if you already know it which defeats the purpose.

<p>Good topos have almost no ego. They aren't really artistic, they are just realistic. Remenber the photo itself isn't important, it's the rock that is, and the more clearly you can show the rock as you would see it in person the better.

<ul>
<li> Take the photo from further back to show more context. This is especially important for bouldering where so many boulders can look the same, or different from different angles.
<li> Take photos from the angle you typically approach them from to aid recognition.
<li> If a feature looks flat in a photo take additional photos from other angles that better show the feature.
<li> Try a wider angle lense, or switch photos together - but be careful: warped / fish eye photos can make it much harder to recongise the rock features.
<li> Keep the horizon level.
<li> Try being slightly elevated. Try standing on nearby boulders or climbing a tree, or rap down and jumar sideways if you want to be a pro.
</ul>



<h2>Tip 2: Good topos ARE good photos</h2>
<p>The fundamentals of a good topo photo are the same as taking any photo. The lighting needs to be good, the exposure needs to be right etc.
 You don't need to be a gun camera nerd just get the basics right:

<p><b class="label label-success">Good</b> Sharp, well lit, </p>
</div>

<p><b class="label label-warning">Bad</b> Blurred, uneven light, poorly cropped</p>
</div>
</div>


<ul>
<li> Avoid harsh sun with harsh shadows, or dappled shade. In bad light tend to err by over exposing so that the darker rock tones are properly exposed. It doens't matter if the sky is whiteout.
<li> Take as sharp a picture as you can, with a wide depth of field and correct focus.  and avoid camera shake by using a tripod, bracing against a tree or even building a small cairn.
<li> Take as hi-res a picture as you can - check your settings are on full size. Use a proper camera if your phone camera isn't great.
</ul>


<h2>Tip 3: Other helpful stuff</h2>

<p><b class="label label-success">Good</b> Scale is obvious</p>
</div>

<p><b class="label label-warning">Bad</b> What scale is this?</p>
</div>
</div>


<ul>
<li> Scale is important and rock can often look the same at different scales. For bouldering a mat in the photo is ideal.
 For a multipitch topo having a climber is helpful as long as they aren't obsuring anything important on the route.
<li> Photos are cheap, so take more. Especially approach photos can be helpful later when you can't remember where you where.
<li> If you can record the GPS location, and for bonus points the direcion the photo was taken in. 
</ul>
