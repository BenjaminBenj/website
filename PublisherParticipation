Publisher Participation

<p>thecrag.com model of sharing climb beta has been developed with publisher's in mind. The model is to distribute climbing information through multiple channels, the website being one channel.</p>

<p>Publisher's may distribute their information through thecrag.com as well. As a participating publisher you will continue to own your content with thecrag.com being a custodian subject to agreement. thecrag.com's web system supports <a href="/article/mixedcopyright">mixed copyrights</a>, where a publisher is in control of their content copyright.</p>

<p>thecrag.com is well on it's way to producing a comprehensive global index of areas and routes. We would like to use this index for climbers and publishers to share climbing information in more depth including topos, descriptions, photos and maps. We are busy building the essential web climbing tools to support collection, distribution and publishing of quality climbing information.</p>

<p>By participating in thecrag.com a publisher may benefit by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ongoing contributions to their data (eg new route feed)</li>
  <li>ascent comment feeds, and community ratings</li>
  <li>continued ownership of content</li>
  <li>data management services</li>
</ul>

<p>As a publisher you will be given your own account logins to access and manage your data. Any descriptions, photos and topos a publisher account contributes will be attributed to the publisher.</p>

<p>Subject to thecrag.com agreement you will have the option of registering a crag level copyright. This will give you a copyright statement displayed  at the the crag level of the index and the option of climbers attributing any area and route descriptions to you.</p>

<p>We can also help with the data entry for a particular publication. Climbers may be assigned a working publication, whereby they can enter area and climb descriptions attributed to that publication (and publisher). By doing so they earn <a href="/articles/cragkarma">Crag Karma</a> points.</p>

<p>You don't have to make your copyright content visible in the website. However if you don't then eventually climbers will just add the content themselves based on their own experience. If you do make your content visible then there is little incentive for climbers to duplicate this information.</p>
