<p>theCrag allows some basic formatting inside of area and route descriptions.
 It is baseed on a very natural text format called Markdown with a few extra twists that we're calling <span title="Thanks GitHub we love you!">"theCrag Flavored Markdown"</span>.
</p>

<p>The examples below should show you almost everything you need to create great guides, but if you want more you can check out the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown Syntax Guide</a> at Daring Fireball.</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>For most descriptions, a few small bits of markup goes a long way. Below are most common type of markup you'll need:</p>

<div class="input">
<h2>Example text input</h2>
<textarea>
This is the first paragraph which contains a reference to a subarea 'Arapiles' and a route 'Kachoong'

1) 5.12a This is an example of how to mark up pitches of a climb. Make sure there is a blank line before the first item.
2) 5.11c This is the second pitch. Watch out for sea gulls.

This is another deeply interesting paragraph about stuff.

* This is the first item in a bullet list
* This is the second item in a bullet list
