<p>The ‘Bulk Edit’ tool makes tidying up existing data a whole lot easier for Editors.</p>

<p>At any crag, you can go</p>

<p>>Action >Update >Bulk Edit</p>

<p>then select the fields you want to update and a customized form will be built. So you can create a simple form to quickly fill out the data for a single item (eg Area Type), or a complex one that allows you to update everything at once- like an editable guidebook.</p>
