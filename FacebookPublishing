<h2>Logging Ascents</h2>

<p>Once setup, every time you log an ascent you will be given the option to tell the system to also post the ascent on your Facebook Wall. The ascent must have been made in the last 10 days.</p>

<p>If you are logging a single ascent then the copy of the post shall be:</p>

<p>Climbed [CLIMB] climbs at [AREA] on [DATE]: [COMMENT]. </p>

<p>If you are logging multiple shots for one climb then the copy of the post shall be:</p>

<p>Climbed [SHOTS] shots of [CLIMB] at [AREA] on [DATE]: [SHOT#] - [COMMENT];</p>

<p>If you are logging multiple ascents for an area then you will be given the opportunity to select individually which ascents will be posted on you Facebook Wall. Posted ascents will have the same format as for logging a single ascent.</p>


<p>Posts will also have a link to a climb, so your friends will be able to see what you have climbed.</p>
