General info - Seasonality

<p>The seasonality chart shows ascents by month.</p>

<p>Effectively this shows how popular an area is relative to other months.</p>

<p>Because people climb more around school holidays such as Christmas, there is a bias towards months with major holidays.</p>

<p>Please note that the best months to climb in an area may not be the most popular.</p>
