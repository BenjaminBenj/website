4 Ticking and logbooks - 5 Tick types
<%perl>
use CIDS::Application::StaticVersions;
</%perl>

<p>These are the different types of ticks you can use when logging ascents:</p>

% my $groups = $ARGS{data}->{tickGroups};

<table class="tickTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Image
      </th>
      <th>
        Name
      </th>
      <th>
        Meaning
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
% foreach my $group ( @{$groups} )   {
    <tr class="groupRow">
      <td colspan=3>
        <strong><% $group->{name} %></strong><span> (<% $group->{description} %>)</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
% my $ticks = $group->{ticks};
% foreach my $tick ( @{$ticks} )   {
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="20" height="18" src="<% static('cids/images/single_icon_'.$tick->{label}.'.png') %>" title="<% $tick->{name} %>" />
      </td>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">
        <% $tick->{name} %>
      </td>
      <td>
        <% $tick->{description} %>
      </td>
    </tr>
% }
% }
  </body>
</table>

<p>
NB. Unlike the other categories, the distinction between the different types of 'Attempted Ascents' is more about the psychology/style than detail/nuance. i.e. The tick types are identical physically (you tried a route but didn't make it), but psychologically from a sport climbing/bouldering point of view you might be 'working' a route (making muiltiple attempts as you work towards a Red Point or clean ascent); from a trad climber's perspective you might have tried and got spanked.
