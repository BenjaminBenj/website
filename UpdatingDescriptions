About updating descriptions

<p>Routes and areas have several different fields that may be edited, depending on the area type (see <a href="/article/areatypes">area types</a> article). Some of these fields (Ethic and Access) will be inherited from parent levels when browsing the index. This means you only have to put the ethic of a crag in once and it will be visible at all descendant areas.</p>

<p>Normally when you enter a description it will be submitted under <a href="/processmap/copyright">thecrag.com copyright</a>. The system also allows for descriptions to be submitted under third party publishers copyright. In this case the attributed publisher will be the primary owner of the information and thecrag.com will be custodians of that information.</p>

<p>In order to submit area and route descriptions attributed to a third party publisher that publisher must be set up correctly in the system. There are three ways you can attribute new descriptions to another publisher:</p>

<ol>
<li>Publisher account</li>
<li>Working publication</li>
<li>Publisher crag copyright</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that all of these scenarios involve negotiation with the publisher, and administration set up in the system.</p>

<h2>Copyright Attribution</h2>

<p>Content attributed to a publisher is owned by the publisher.</p>

<h3>Publisher account</h3>

<p>If your account is set up as a publisher account then your copyright submissions are attributed to that publisher. Everytime a copyright submission is made there will be a publisher copyright reminder.</p>


<h3>Working publication</h3>

<p>If a publisher has agreed to have content from a particular publication entered into the system, then you may help with the data entry. To do this we have to set up your account with a working publication. When set up, every time you enter an area or route description in the publication area you will have the option of attributing it to the publisher.</p>

<p>Even though the publisher has been attributed with the content you will get the <a href="/articles/cragkarma">Crag Karma</a> points for the data entry.</p>


<h3>Publisher crag copyright</h3>

<p>A publisher wanting all their material to be entered into the system under their copyright can set up a broad based crag copyright. This will allow any standard user to attribute any contribution under that crag to the publisher. If set up then you can copy any of that publishers material to the system.</p>

<p>All content submitted to the publisher in this way is owned by the attributed publisher.</p>



<h3>Public copyright</h3>

<p>If no publisher is set up for you to attribute then you will be submitting content under thecrag.com's copyright.</p>


<h3>Changing publisher</h3>

<p>There are times where descriptions from multiple publishers are available in an area or route. If the content is set to editable then you can update each of these separately by using the 'Select Another Publisher' button.</p>



<h2>Please respect copyright</h2>

<p>If thecrag.com does not have an agreement with the publisher, please respect the publishers copyright. We do not want unsolicited copyright material being added to the site as it causes all sorts of headaches. You may submit material based on your own experience and researching serveral guidebooks, but don't copy out of guidebooks.</p>
