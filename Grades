<p>We want to work with the rock climbing community to get a comprehensive and intuitive coverage of grades in the system. This is a long term initiative and at times will involve fundamental changes to the way grades work on the site. We welcome feedback on grades, but for this to be useful to the community as a whole it has to go onto our <a href="/article/issues"><img src="/static/silk/bug.png" width="16" height="16"/> issues list</a>. We don't promise to fix things straight away, but we will link the discussion into this article so that the whole community can constructively contribute.</p>

<p>This article covers the following topics:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#s1">Grade conversions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#s2">Grade bands</a></li>
  <li><a href="#s3">How are grades assigned to routes?</a></li>

<p>Internally grade conversions work by converting each grade to a fine-grained internal number range between 0-500.</p>

<p>If you would like programatic access to the grades and grade conversions through the <a href="/article/API">API</a> then you should get in contact with us. The programatic version of this table is available through the following API call:</p>

<h2><a name="s2" href="#s2">2. Grade bands</a></h2>

<p>For use on thecrag.com we have divided climb difficulty ratings into 5 segments - Beginner, Intermediate, Experienced, Expert and Elite. These definitions are somewhat arbitrary, but they are based on many years of climbing experience and there are also some statistical reasons for breaking climbing into these segments.</p>

<p>There are two common area difficulty graphs used throughout the site, the grade band and dual grade band.</p>

<img src="/static/cids/images/difficultybanddemo-1.1.1.gif" width="640" height="180" alt="Grade bands summary" />

<p> The grade band chart shows the relative number of climbs at the particular difficuly bands. This is shown at each area and should give you a quick summary of the area's relative difficulty.</p>

<p>The dual grade band shows also what grades people are climbing at an area, based on the number of ascents at each grade. This is interesting, because some areas may have a lot of hard climbs, but the easier climbs are climbed more often (eg Arapiles) and other areas have a lot of easier climbs, but people go there for the hard climbs (eg Grampians).</p>

<p> The table below fives a brief description of each band.</p>

<table class="data">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td scope="col" class="gb1">Beginner</td>
      <td scope="col">The level of difficulty for your first couple of days of climbing (seconding or top roping). Many people may achieve these grades on their first day of climbing. There are still some very scary and/or dangerous climbs at this level (eg Bard). </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="col" class="gb2">Intermediate</td>
      <td scope="col">Typical grades for people with less than a years climbing. Note that most people cannot climb this level on their first couple of days of climbing. Statistically speaking, most outdoor climbing is done in this band. A lot of experienced climbers end up backing off to this level as they enjoy their climbing into old age.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="col" class="gb3">Experienced</td>
      <td scope="col">People can achieve these levels if they have been climbing fairly regularily for a couple of years. These grades are where the social climbers start becoming rare.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="col" class="gb4">Expert</td>
      <td scope="col">You really need to be training in a focused way to climb at this level. Not so many people reach this level.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="col" class="gb5">Elite</td>
      <td scope="col">You climb for a living, are sponsored and have a full time trainer and massuer looking after you. This is the best of the best. If you are normal, you would not have a hope of even dogging up one of these climbs.</td>

<h2><a name="s3" href="#s3">3. How are grades asigned to routes?</a></h2>

<p>Routes have a registered grade and a list of independent user and publisher grade contributions (a publisher contribution is a citation from a publication). The user and publisher grade contributions are displayed on the route page. The official grade of the route is given by the registered grade.</p>


<h3>3.1 Registered grade</h3>

<p>The registered grade is the official grade of the route, and is used through out the website and publications.</p>

<p>A registered grade may have multiple components, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A free climbing grade (5.12a) and an aid grade (A3), combined would read <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb3">5.12a A3</span>.</li>
  <li>British technical (4a) and adjectival (MS), combined would read <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb2">MS 4a</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A route may have official grades from several different grading systems (eg in Thailand many routes have an official French and Australian grade). For example:<p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <a href="http://www.thecrag.com/route/17710201">http://www.thecrag.com/route/17710201</a>
</div>
<p>The above route, "Knights In White Satin" has a registered grade of <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb4">7b+</span> French and <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb4">26</span> Australian Ewbanks. Because the Thailand is assigned the French context the French grade will be shown on the site. (Question: Do we want to show the Australian grade to Australian users?)</p>

<p>Once a route has a registered grade it can only be changed by an Editor and is not affected by subsequent user contributions.</p>


<h3>3.2 Grade contributions</h3>

<p>Anybody may make a grade contribution. A climb may have several grade contributions from users and publishers.</p>

<p>When you add a new route, the grade you enter becomes your grade contribution (unless you are citing a publication, in which case in becomes a publisher contribution). For new routes your grade contribution also becomes the registered grade.<p>

<p>You may add your user grade contribution to an existing route using the update route details process. If the route already has a registered grade then this will not be effected (otherwise your contribution is used to start the registered grade).</p>


<h3>3.3 Grade ranges</h3>

<p>Behind the scenes everything is a grade range with a minimum grade and maximum grade. Mostly people will use just one grade, but on occasions it is useful to use a grade range for a particular route (eg you may input 5.10a-b, which will be interpreted by the sytem as a grade range and displayed as <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb2">5.10a to 5.10b</span>.</p>

<p>Grade ranges are absolutely necessary for grade conversions. Very few grade conversions match exactly there is usually overlap. For example 5.8 in the Yosemite Decimal System maps to both 15 and 16 in the Australian Ewbanks system.</p>

<p>We are planning a future enhancement where we represent each grade to a probability bell curve because this represents more accurately what a grade is. For example a route usually takes on the grade of the first assentionist, which is subjective. The first assentionist is feeling really strong that day, and they think the route is a 5.10a, when in actual fact most climbers would have though it is a 5.10b. All climbers have come across routes that are easier or harder then the grade suggests. Over time grades which are way off may be corrected, but ultimately if you got a 100 climbers to independently grade a route, you will not get exactly the same answer from each climber (leaving aside arguments about differences between short and tall climbers). This suggests that route grades are probablistic.<p>


<h3>3.4 Aid eliminates</h3>

<p>A route may orinally be a 5.10b A4, then later somebody may climb it as a 5.11a A0, then later as a 5.12c. In this scenario the route should have the cleanest grade as its registered grade, but may have all the other grades listed as grade contributions.</p>


<h3>3.5 Special rating systems</h3>

<p>Although not part of the registered grade you can include some additional rating systems in your grade contributions. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stars</li>
  <li>Protection rating</li>
</ul>

<p>If you add a *, ** or *** to the end of your grade contribution the system will recognise this a star rating. See <a href="/article/Stars">how stars work</a>.</p>

<p>You may also use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_%28climbing%29#YDS_protection_rating">YDS protection rating</a> in your grade contribution. The system will assign the worst case protection rating to the route and display that alongside the registered grade if it is a R or X protection rating. For example if you made a grade contribution of "5.10d X" then the route will be displayed as <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb3">5.10d X</span>.</p> 





<h2><a name="s4" href="#s4">4. How are grades asigned to ascents?</a></h2>

<p>This area needs a complete rethink because the system is a little restrictive. If you want to contribute to a community discussion see the following issue in our issues list:</p> 

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/theCrag/website/issues/304"><img src="/static/silk/bug.png" width="16" height="16"/> Complexity of grades respective logging of ascents</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Currently when you log an ascent the asent will automatically take the route's registered grade as the ascent grade. If there are multiple registered grades (eg British Adjectival and Technical or Free and Aid) then the system will ask you to choose one of these to be associated with the ascent.</p>

<p>A logged ascent has a single grade independent of the route's grade. This has the following implications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may update your ascent to any grade you want, such as a different grading system or different grade to the route.</li>
  <li>If it is an aid climb you have to choose whether you log the Aid component or the Free component (currently you cannot have both).</li>
  <li>Similarily if it is a British climb have to choose whether you log the Adjectival or Technical grade.</li>
</ul>

<p>To adjust your ascent's grade after you have logged the ascent follow the following procedure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Log your ascent with the grade from the route.</li>
  <li>Go to your Account page ('My Account' tab) and click on Logbook tab.</li>
  <li>In the ascent you just logged click on the name link under the 'Ascent Label' column.</li>
  <li>Click 'edit' ascent.</li>
  <li>Click 'Update Ascent Grade' button at bottom of screen.</li>
  <li>Select the grading system you want to use for your ascent.</li>
  <li>Select the grade.</li>
  <li>And yes you are done, easy eh - not (we will have to make this simpler at some point, but mostly you will not need this procedure).</li>
</ul>





<h2><a name="s5" href="#s5">5. Grade contexts and parsing</a></h2>

<p>Our aim is for you to contribute grades as you see them in guidebooks and for the platform to be smart enough to work out what you mean.</p>

<h3>5.1 Grade contexts</h3>

<p>What does it mean if you type in the grade '5c'? If you were in Britian you would think it was the Experienced British grade <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb3">5c</span>, but if you were in France you would think it was the Intermediate French grade <span itemprop="contentRating" class="grade gb2">5c</span>. Interpretation of grades is dependent on where you are, this is what we term grade context.</p>

<p>A Grade context is a way of the platform working out how to interpret potentially conficting grades written in plain text, and we set a grade context at the country level.</p>

<p>A grade context is simply a priority list of which grade systems it should check first when matching a grade. For instance in Australia, you can use a french grade, but it will check it first against the locally used Ewbank, and V-Grade bouldering grade systems first, and then if it doesn't match it will check against all the other grade systems. The platform defines as few contexts as possible in order to eliminate conflicts. In general most countries can use the default context.</p>

<p>Currently the system defines the following contexts:</p>


<table class="data">
<tr>
<th style="width: 60px">Code</th>
<th>Grade context</th>
<th style="width: 65%">Countries and Grade Systems</th>
</tr>
% foreach my $context (sort { $a->{label} cmp $b->{label} }  @{ $data->{contexts} } ){
<tr>
<td>
% my $icon = '';
% my $ctx = $context->{label};
% if (defined $icons{$ctx}){
%   $icon = $icons{$ctx};
% }
% if (defined $icon && $icon ne ''){
<img class="flag context" src="<% static "flags/png/$icon".".png" %>">
% }
 <% $context->{label} %>
<td><h4><% $context->{name} %></h4>
<% $context->{description} %>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Countries:</b>  
%   my $shown = 0;
%   foreach my $country ( @{ $data->{countries} } ){
%     my $ctx = $country->{defaultGrading}->{context} || '';
%     if ($context->{label} eq $ctx && $country->{id} && $country->{routes} ){
<% $shown++ ? ', ' : '' %>
<a class="nowrap country" href='<% CIDS::Application::WebHelpers::indexURL($country,type=>'area') %>'>
% my $co = $country->{countryCode};
<img class="flag country" src="<% static "flags/png/".lc($co).".png" %>">
 <% $country->{name} %>\
</a>\
%     }
%   }
<p><b>Priority grade systems:</b>
% $shown = 0;
%#<pre><% Dumper( $context ) %></pre>
% foreach my $sys ( @{ $context->{parseSystems} } ){
%   foreach my $system ( @{ $data->{systems} } ){
%     if ($system->{label} ne $sys ){ next; }
%     if ($system->{label} =~ /ALT/ ){ next; }
%     if ($system->{displayable} ne 1 ){ next; }
%     if ($system->{displayable} ne 1 ){ next; }
%#     if ($system->{abbreviatedName} eq 'Class' ){ next; }
<% $shown++ ? ', ' : '' %>
%     my $type = lc $system->{type};
%     if ($type eq 'free'){ $type = 'trad'; }
<span class="nowrap" title="Abbrev: <% $system->{abbreviatedName} %>,  Type: <% $system->{type} %>"><b class="bullet <% $type %>"></b> <% $system->{name} %></span>\
%   }
% }
<td>
</tr>
% }
</table>

<p>Each country is assigned a context. Hopefully we have got it close to right (see <a href="#s5_3">section 5.3</a>).
 In the table above we only show countries that have routes in them, and new countries default to the US, so if this
 isn't right for a particular country please contact us and we'll fix it. 
</p>
<p> You may change the context of a particular route when you add or update that route.</p>
