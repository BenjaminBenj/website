<p>You're probably familiar with the use of star ratings for routes. (For details on our community-generated route quality ratings read '<a href="/article/Stars">How do stars work?</a>')</p>

<p>We've extended this concept to develop an indicator of crag quality.</p>

<p>We call it Crag Kudos. Basically we reckon that if users who contribute to the site earn <a href="/article/CragKarma">Crag Karma</a> it seems only fair that crags should earn Kudos.</p>

<p>Crags earn Kudos based on how often people climb there and how highly their routes are rated. In other words it's basically a combination of the number of ascents and quality ratings (with a few weightings and other smarts thrown in).</p>

<p>As you browse the index the 'Classic Crags' listed at the top of the left-hand column will be the ones with the highest Crag Kudos for that region.</p>
