5 Connect - 4 Using RSS feeds

<p>Across the site, the <img alt="" src="/static/silk/feed.png" width="16" height="16" /> icon indicates an RSS feed that you can subscribe to.</p>
 
<p>Subscribing to the feeds you're interested in is an easy way to keep in touch with what's going on at your favorite crags, or what your friends are climbing, without even visiting the site.  The main feeds are:</p>
 
<p><strong>Throughout the index</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent ascents at any crag or area</li>
<li>Recent index updates at any crag or area</li>
</ul> 

<p><strong>From your account page</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your recent ascents</li>
<li>Your recent index updates</li>
<li>Combined feed of recent ascents at all your favourite crags</li>
<li>Combined feed of recent index updates at all your favourite crags</li>
<li>Combined feed of all your friends recent ascents.</li>
</ul>
