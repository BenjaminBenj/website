7 Add areas and crags - 03 Naming conventions

<p>This is a working document for developing naming policy for areas and routes in the index. This document is being developed based on community feedback and our experience running a global index of names.</p>

<div class="bore"><div class="alert"><h4>Did you know?</h4>
<p>Any area or route can have multiple names, including a.k.a names, historical names, or names in other languages.</p>
</div></div>

<h1 id="regions">Naming regions</h1>

<ul>
  <li>A country (or parent region) may be broken down into locally recongisable sub regions, such that geographic boundaries can be drawn around them covering the country or parent region.</li>
  <li>Using geo-political boundaries (state, province, etc) may be a suitable way of doing this, but their are often exceptions such as ACT being contained within NSW is Australia. Sometimes there are too many or not relevant to the local community.</li>
  <li>Naming based on features, parks and ranges may also be an accetable way of doing this. The problem with this method is that it is often hard to get complete coverage using geographic snap-lock boundaries.</li>
  <li>We have often found that political boundaries are not ideal as they are shaped by population density. Instead using boundaries that are more relevant to the geography are more relevant to climbers, such as the regions use by weather reporting organisations like the Australian Bureau of Meterology.</li>
  <li>If you are naming a region then siblings areas should also be named using consistent logic.</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="crags">Naming crags</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Crags should be named based on what climbers call the crag (eg 'Frog Buttress').</li>
  <li>An official name (eg a state park).</li>
  <li>If there are different ways of referring to a crag then use the alternate name facility, with priority given to what climbers call a crag.</li>
  <li>There may be other 'language' or 'historical' alternate names that should be set up using the alternate name facility.</li>
  <li>Commonly used abbreviated names may also be set up using the alternate name facility (eg KP for Kangeroo Point).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="language">Language</h1>

<p>Note that we are still developing best practice for local language names verses English names. This is a complex issue and probably involves significant system changes once we decide which way to go. In the meantime please use one of the following methods:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the 'language' alternate name facility.</li>
  <li>Just use the non-english name.</li>
  <li>Place the the language alternate in brackets after the original name.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="routes">Naming routes</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Traditionaly the person who climbs a route has the right to name it.</li>
  <li>A project should be named 'Project' plus a unique way of indentifying it from it's siblings.</li>
  <li>Route names which are offensive to minority groups will not be accepted in the index. While you may have a right to name a route, there are restrictions if you want the name listed in a public community index. We are hoping that this is never a problem.</li>
  <li>We may also have to filter/change certain words in order to publish in various channels with a content rating that is not too restrictive. Basically just don't use rude words and expect to be able to read it in your mobile app.</li>
  <li>For names which are lost in the mists of time, use a generic name like 'Black arete', or 'Thin face'. It's not ideal but it's better than 10 'unknowns'
  <li>Really avoid using numbers as names, as new routes are done the numbers get old and you end up with 6a and it gets ugly and messy. We have an automatic numbering system and seeing both numbers is confusing.
</ul>


<h1 id="other">Naming cliffs, boulders, etc</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Traditionaly the person who discovers the first route for the cliff/boulder gets to name it.</li>
</ul>
