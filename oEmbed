7 Extend - 2 oEmbed theCrag
<%perl>
my $markdown = <<EOF;

Please note this is a technical article to help people embed theCrag stuff on their blog and WordPress sites. If you don't know, embeding means you can type in a resource url (eg photo) and the website will render it as the actual photo rather then the url you typed in. This is very handy shorthand for saving a lot of HTML coding.

If you want to read about embeding external photos and videos into theCrag descriptions and forums then read the <a href="/article/EmbedingImages">Embeding photos and videos</a> article.

This article is a technical how to article for people who have either got expertise in WordPress or in setting up client side oEmbed.

Currently embeding theCrag stuff is limited to theCrag photos and competitions.

`http://www.thecrag.com/competition/*`

Further resources will be developed.

# WordPress

The latest WordPress releases have significant embeding capability, but it will not embed theCrag without you making some amendments.


# DIY oEmbed

If you do not know what oEmbed is then you are brave reading this far. Here is some extra reading:

http://oembed.com/

theCrag oEmbed provider url is:

`http://www.thecrag.com/oembed`

And accepts the following parameters:

 * **format**: theCrag currently only supports 'json' format. If this parameter is omitted then json will be assumed.
 * **url**: mandatory url of the resource you want to embed.
 * **callback**: the callback function name for jsonp
 * **maxwidth**: part of the standard, but most sites are going responsive so should not be used
 * **maxheight**: ditto

Returns json resource as per oEmbed standard.

The url regular expressions that are currently accepted are:

  * https?:\\/\\/(www\.)?thecrag\\.com\\/photo\\/\\d+
  * https?:\\/\\/(www\\.)?thecrag\\.com\\/competition\\/\\d+
